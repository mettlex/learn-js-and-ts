`[Draft Release #1]`

### Step 1. Learn JavaScript (ECMAScript) well enough to build things like basic web apps

> How to learn JS very well?

(a) Start with easy basics on Sololearn. Finish two courses: ["Intro to JS"](https://www.sololearn.com/learn/courses/javascript-introduction) and ["JavaScript Intermediate"](https://www.sololearn.com/learn/courses/javascript-intermediate).

- At this moment, don't just copy-paste others people's code without understanding. Understanding every line that you write in code is very crucial for your success.
- Use [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) for the official docs and more in-depth knowledge.

(b) If you feel a little confident, be serious about JS basics on freeCodeCamp. Finish the following courses:

- ["JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures"](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/) - Don't forget to build these things by yourself using JS: [Palindrome Checker, Roman Numeral Converter, Caesars Cipher, Telephone Number Validator, Cash Register](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/#javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-projects)
- Try to clearly distinguish among the 3 paradigms in JS: **Procedural**, **Object-oriented** and **Functional** Programming. Build a Todo app with offline local storage support in both **OOP** and **FP** paradigms. You may finish the first version naively in somewhat procedural way. Make it work without any bugs. Then convert the code to OOP and FP separately. <br/> _You may create two git branches: one for OOP, another for FP._

### Step 2. Learn TypeScript & JSDoc to sprinkle some type-safety on top of JavaScript madness

> How to learn TS very well?

(a) Learn from TypeScript gurus and wizards:

- [Beginner's TypeScript](https://www.totaltypescript.com/tutorials/beginners-typescript) by [Matt Pocock](https://www.mattpocock.com/)
- [No BS TS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKVHFHJsiO0&list=PLNqp92_EXZBJYFrpEzdO2EapvU0GOJ09n) YouTube series by [Jack Herrington](https://www.jackherrington.com/). Learn up to `No BS TS #19 - Utility Types in Typescript - Part 2` and skip React with TS and other advanced patterns for now.
- **Convert your previously built Todo app from JS to TS.** Use TS `interface` feature in OOP branch and TS `type` feature in FP branch. Never use `any` keyword or suppress using `!` symbol at last.
- Learn more from the official sources: [TS for JS Programmers](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html) and [TS Handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/basic-types.html)

### Step 3. Learn React library for rendering UI stuff

(a) Take a free tour of [react.gg](https://react.gg) - The interactive way to master modern React

(b) React's official docs site is the best way to learn React: [https://react.dev/learn](https://react.dev/learn)

(c) [Jack Herrington](https://www.jackherrington.com/) has a good [YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8AVXNozac8&list=PLNqp92_EXZBKa1U7JbgUwBnDk3XzYDvXe). It might get outdated after a few years so keep eyes on his channel.

(d) [React with TypeScript](https://www.totaltypescript.com/tutorials/react-with-typescript) by [Matt Pocock](https://www.mattpocock.com/)

(e) Recreate your previous Todo app in **React** with **TypeScript**.

### Step 4. Learn back-end stuff with Node.js & Deno.

`[todo]`

### Step 5. Learn Next.js full-stack framework for the web apps

`[todo]`

### Step 6. Learn Expo + React Native for native mobile apps

`[todo]`

### Step 7. Learn Algorithms & Better Programming

(a) [The Last Algorithms Course You'll Need](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/algorithms/) by [ThePrimeagen](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen)

### Step 8. Learn Other Programming Languages

- Don't limit yourself to one or two programming languages.
- Learn C & Rust. Target Web Assembly.
- Learn Python for AI & Machine Learning.
- Learn the best stack in the technology you want to work on.
